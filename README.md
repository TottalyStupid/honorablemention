This is a multiplayer version of the game [Inscryption](https://www.inscryption.com/) made by [Daniel Mullins](https://twitter.com/dmullinsgames).

It's fully open-source and runs in the web browser, so you can play it with your friends without having to download anything.

If you want to contribute to the project or are just curious what services I use, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
